run.sh automates running batches of benchmarks.  Usage:

./run.sh <benchmark-list> <results-directory> [<timeout>]

<benchmark-list> is a file where each line is a relative path, from this
    directory, to an .fr to be run
<results-directory> is the name of a non-existing directory where the output
    files will be stored
<timeout> is an optional argument that specifies a number of seconds after
    which to kill each individual benchmark (60 to 1800 recommended)

There are three existing benchmark lists in .txt files:
  fast.txt contains the benchmarks from the paper that terminate quickly (within
           approximately one minute); all use vacuously true qualification
 fastQ.txt contains the non-trivial qualification benchmarks (not included in
           the paper) that terminate quickly
   all.txt contains all of the files from the qual/ and noqual/ directories
           (this will take a LONG time to run, in general; be sure to use
           a timeout)
